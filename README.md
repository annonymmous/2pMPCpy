Python Implemantation for Two Party MPC ECDSA
-----------------------

This project aims to provide a reference implementation of a secure multiparty computation for elliptic curve signing with two parties.

This project is useful for creating Python Eggs, and Debian packages (.deb) for both Python 2 and 3.

*Should be compatible with Python >=2.7 and >= 3.4.*

Python Implemantation for Two Party MPC ECDSA
-----------------------

This project aims to provide a reference implementation of a secure multiparty computation for elliptic curve signing with two parties.



*Should be compatible with Python >= 3.4.*

Code is implemented as an extension to ECPy: http://cslashm.github.io/ECPy/
Paillier Partially Homomorphic Encryption is based on: https://github.com/mikeivanov/paillier

This is explanatory code and not meant for production use
